# Rule Based Recommender System

Business Problem
Creating new level-based customer definitions (personas) by using some features of a game company's customers and adding these new customer definitions. It wants to create segments according to these segments and estimate how much the new customers can earn according to these segments. E.g. It is desired to determine how much a 25-year-old male user from Turkey who is an IOS user can earn on average.

Dataset Story
The Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information about the users who buy these products.The dataset consists of records created in each sales transaction. This means the table is not deduplicated. In other words, certain demographic information. A user with features may have made more than one purchase.

Variables     
PRICE – Customer's spending amount        
SOURCE – The type of device the customer is connecting to     
SEX – Gender of the client    
COUNTRY – Country of the customer       
AGE – Age of the customer   

Warning!          
I should point out that I cannot share the dataset because it is not open source.
